**Multi-File Search Tool** 🔍  

A simple command-line program that searches for a keyword in multiple files, reading them **line by line** using `get_next_line`. It prints matching lines along with their **file name and line number**. Supports efficient multi-file handling and can be extended with additional features like case-insensitive search or recursive directory scanning. 🚀
